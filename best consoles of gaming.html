		<p>
			PlayStation 4 is unofficially announced at the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas on January 8
			2013
			by the vice president of Sony Home Entertainment, Hiroshi Sakamoto7. According to him, the console will
			presented
			with
			certainty at E3 2013 or, a little before, in May. "It's a big secret. But our colleagues from the brand
			PlayStation
			prepare themselves. I can only say that we are focusing on E3, scheduled for June. The announcement will
			perhaps
			performed at this time, or even earlier in May. ".

			Some specialized websites announce its probable presentation in February 20138, during a
			convention
			exceptional from Sony. The rumors don't stop there as another famous site / magazine certifies the
			Release
			the console in 20139.


			The console's existence was officially announced by Sony on February 20, 201310, but the console
			herself
			is not disclosed. The presentation focuses on the new model of the DualShock controller, the support
			publishers
			and third-party developers, such as Blizzard and Bungie, the presentation of several games, Diablo III,
			Destiny and
			Watch
			Dogs, among which are the exclusives Killzone: Shadow Fall, fourth episode of the series
			Killzone, and
			inFamous: Second Son. In addition, Knack and DriveClub, two original titles highlighting the
			characteristics
			and functions of the console are presented10.

			The PlayStation 4 is officially unveiled on June 11, 2013 during the Sony conference at E3.
			Games and
			technical details are then presented as well as the design of the console. The Japanese firm announces its
			positioning vis-à-vis the policy engaged by Microsoft on its Xbox One, in particular on the questions of
			connection
			mandatory, blocking used games and console zoning, stating that this policy does not
			would be
			not hers11. A few days after this announcement, Microsoft, under pressure from its
			competitor
			as well as many critics, decides to cancel these constraints to align with the PlayStation 412.

			In August 2013, several resellers such as Micromania, FNAC and even Amazon declared that the delivery of the
			console
			the day of its release would no longer be guaranteed for new pre-orders13,14. Despite 16 million
			units
			produced, this may be insufficient to meet demand around the world. Sony
			ad
			however, additional units will be delivered to points of sale on the day of release. The
			builders
			prefer to advertise that it is difficult to meet demand than to be unable to sell a stock as was
			the
			case
			at the launch of the PlayStation 314.15.

			During gamescom 2013, Sony announces that the PlayStation 4 will be released on November 15 in
			United States and
			November 29 in Europe16.

			It was during their conference at TGS 2013 that Sony announced that the PlayStation 4 will be released on
			the archipelago
			Japanese
			only on February 22, 201417.

			For its launch in Brazil in November 2013, the console is sold for the sum of € 1,020 (more than three
			times the
			prices in Europe). This sum is linked to import costs and taxes which are between 60 and 70%
			of
			price

		</p>

		<h3>Design</h3><br>

		<p>The original design of the PlayStation 4 was revealed at E3 2013; the shell is in the shape of a
			parallelogram, or
			more
			exactly of Parallelepiped cut in two across the width by a trench, or notch,
			strictly
			center going around the console, giving the visual impression of two parallelepipeds
			identical
			aligned and stacked. In the central slot are located on the front the Blu-ray player type "
			disc eater ",
			two USB27 ports as well as the "Power" and "Eject" buttons. The console is black with surfaces
			matt
			and brilliant separated, in the direction of the depth, by a central furrow, making him also all the turn
			of
			the
			console, from which emanates, on the top face, a light bar, which is white when the console is
			allumée28,
			blue when the PS4 is switched on and off and orange in standby mode; the official name of this
			color
			East "
			Jet Black ”. The console can either be placed vertically or horizontally28. This aesthetic
			East
			the work of a young Japanese designer employed at Sony; the PS4 was designed in-house, the brand having
			choose to
			do not use the services of Teiyu Goto, who had so far signed the various models of
			consoles
			of the
			firme28. The console weighs 2.8 kg for dimensions of 275 mm in width, 305 mm in depth and 53 mm in
			épaisseur29.

			This design will be generalized, and the PS4 models which will succeed the original model will keep the
			"cut parallelepiped".

		</p>

		<h3>Modèles</h3>


		<h4>Modèle original</h4>

		<p>The original PS4 model has undergone two slight changes, making it up into three variants
			clear
			différentes30. This model is retroactively nicknamed the PS4 "Fat", to distinguish it from the models
			of
			PS4
			succeeding him.

			The first model marketed during the launch of the console, having for reference CUH-1000, then
			CUH-1100,
			East
			equipped with a 500 GB hard drive, its price is $ 399 / € 399 31. Packs including games and accessories
			additional are also offered during this launch period.

			A new variant, sometimes called "chassis C", whose manufacturer reference is CUH-1200, is announced
			in
			June
			2015. It is lighter by 300 g and less energy hungry by 8%. Contrary to information
			published
			in
			certain press articles, it is not thinner than the CUH-1000 and CUH-1100 variants, the design
			being
			strictly the same between these three versions, except for a change in the type of plastic for the
			hood
			of
			hard drive: it loses its shiny side, for an entirely matte shell32.33. Among other details which
			change
			compared to the original variant, the Power and Eject buttons are no longer tactile and become
			mécaniques34.

			At this same period, another model - retaining the technical characteristics of the version
			initial of
			500
			GB - is added to the range with a storage capacity this time of 1 TB (its price of
			sale
			is the
			same as the 500 GB version) 35.</p>
		<h4>Révisions matérielles</h4>

		<p> During 2016, Sony announces two new PS4 models: a new slim PS4 and the PS4 Pro.
			They
			replace the original model, because Sony announces in parallel the cessation of production of it36. Before
			this
			official announcement, media rumors initially evoked the "PS4 Neo", before
			to consider,
			in
			a second time, the fact that there can be two models, the "Slim" as well as the "Neo", which corresponds to
			that
			who
			will be officially called "PS4 Pro".

			On the design aspect, these two new models have several things in common: they lose track
			central
			of the PS4 Fat, they are distinguished by an identity with the "rounded" appearance of the parallelepipeds
			by
			compared to
			the "angular" aspect of the PS4 Fat (especially at the edges), and mark the introduction
			of the
			"feet
			PlayStation ", where the console feet are shaped like one of the four Cross logos (PlayStationX.svg),
			Triangle
			(PlayStationTriangle.svg), Square (PlayStationSquare.svg) and Round (PlayStationCircle.svg) embossed
			on the
			shell.</p>
		<h4> PS4 Slim</h4>

		<p>September 2016 sees the launch of a new model officially named PlayStation 4 or PS437, and
			fluently
			PS4
			“Slim” by the media38 and the public, but also by the Sony company itself, especially on their websites
			after-sales service official 39. It differs from the original model by a new aspect: the concept
			general of
			"Double parallelepiped" is maintained, but they are of different sizes, with the lower larger
			that the
			superior. On the technical aspect, it has similar configurations compared to the PS4 Fat with
			however improvements in Wi-Fi (from 802.11 b / g / n to 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac), Bluetooth (from 2.1 to
			4.0)
			so
			than
			USB connectors (from 3.0 to 3.1). It also has a reduced size and weight compared to
			to the
			previous models as well as various modifications, one of the most significant being the disappearance of the
			taking
			S / PDIF-TOSLINK, called "Optical Out". This new version is offered with a 500 GB hard drive
			(exit
			the 16th
			September) or 1 TB (released September 28, 2016) 40.

		</p>
		<h4>PS4 Pro</h4>

		<p>In November 2016, Sony launches a more powerful version of the PS4, officially named PS4 Pro,
			allowing
			the compatibility of some games with the Ultra HD41 format, as well as a smoother execution of some
			games
			through
			compared to PS4 "non-Pro". On the aspect, it is a "triple parallelepiped" of which the three
			parallelepipeds
			are almost the same size. The light bar has been moved to the front in the lower notch, which
			houses
			also the two USB 3.1 ports as well as a bar on which the "Power" and "Eject" buttons are located.
			The upper notch houses the optical drive, always of the "disc-eater" type. On the aspect
			Connections, it keeps the PS4 Fat connectors while having a USB socket added to the back.

		<h3>Histoire</h3>
		<p>The console development kit is codenamed Durango7. The final version, named Xbox One,
			East
			officially presented on May 21, 2013 during a live broadcast organized by Microsoft8. Details
			and
			additional information is presented at a new conference on June 10, 2013 on the occasion
			of
			E3 20139, later, during the show, the console is playable by the public10.

			The machine responds to voice commands dictated by the user11. It is during the first presentation
			of the
			console, May 21, 2013, that the demonstration is made by Yusef Mehdi, vice-president of the branch
			Microsoft Interactive dedicated to entertainment, which, by stating "Xbox on", then "Xbox, go home", pushes
			the
			console to turn on, then return to the main menu after navigating its
			interface12.

			At the same time, during an event in London to celebrate the announcement of the Xbox One, the sales manager
			English says Microsoft's new Kinect device must be connected
			for
			that the console can operate 13.

			During the console presentation conference, Microsoft announces that internet access is required.
			So,
			after 24 hours without being connected, the console would no longer be able to read
			and
			run the games 14. Regarding second-hand games, the games could be sold in “shops
			partners ”. Microsoft announces that it does not directly tax resale, but leaves the possibility to
			publishers
			third party to be able to apply such a policy 15. As for sharing, it would not be possible to
			give one
			play only once, and to a person that the player has had in his friends list for a period of at least
			minus thirty days. Microsoft says "up to ten family members can play your
			toy library
			shared ”15.


			Finally, after many criticisms and faced with competition that does not apply a policy
			similar,
			Microsoft is forced to back down on June 19, 2013 by canceling all these constraints, with
			as
			aim to return to Xbox 360 standards16,17. A patch brought by a system update is
			necessary to remove DRM and compulsory internet connection18.

			A month later, Microsoft, wishing to get closer to independent publishers, declares (through
			Mark
			Whitten) that the need to partner with a licensed publisher to publish a video game for the Xbox One is
			canceled. In addition, all consoles sold commercially can be used as a development kit. For
			Finally, Marc Whitten announces that there is no limit on the types of games that can be created19. The
			console
			is released in France, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Austria, United States, Canada,
			Brazil,
			Mexico, Australia and New Zealand on November 22, 20131, then in Japan and in twenty-five other countries in
			September 2014 20.

			In June 2015, during E3 2015, Microsoft presents several things including different games, a new
			controller
			(Elite) for demanding players, backward compatibility with Xbox 360 games, Xbox Game Preview
			(Allowing
			try games in preview), a partnership with Oculus Rift21.

			During E3 2016, Microsoft presents various games, the Xbox Play Anywhere (possibility to start a
			part
			on PC and finish it on Xbox and vice versa), a program (Xbox Design Lab) allowing to customize according to
			the
			wish an Xbox One controller (Xbox One Elite controller is not included) and confirmation from Project
			Scorpio
			(Which will be later, Xbox One X) 22.

			During E3 2017, Microsoft presents various games, its Project Scorpio under the name of Xbox One X, the
			backward compatibility with 1st Xbox games on Xbox One, the ability to play Minecraft with
			players from different platforms (Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PC and mobile WP / W10M, Android and iOS, but not
			sure
			PS4 following Sony's refusal of the cross-platform for commercial reasons), a 4K graphics package for
			Minecraft23.</p>
		<h3>designe</h3>
		<p>The Xbox One is characterized by a sober and angular design evoking a multimedia box, it is
			color
			black with shiny and matt surfaces. The console must be installed in a horizontal position. In
			facade,
			the console has two touch buttons, one for switching on, the other for opening the Blu-ray player
			of
			disc eater type 8.30. The console weighs 3.2 kg with dimensions of 34.4 × 26.3 × 8 cm31.

		</p>
		<h3>Modèles et versions</h3><br>
		<h4>Modèle original</h4>
		<p>A model equipped with a 500 GB hard drive is available when the console is launched in November 201332.

			Microsoft announces on May 13, 2014 the release of the console without Kinect for June 9, 2014. This pack
			allows

			At the end of 2014, a model in the colors of the Call of Duty license, equipped with a 1 TB hard drive, was
			commercialisé34.

			During E3 2015, a new version equipped with a 1 TB hard drive is presented; she is available
			at
			from June 16, 35. </p>
		<h4>Xbox One S</h4>
		<p>Lors de l'E3 2016, Microsoft présente une nouvelle version de la Xbox One, baptisée la Xbox One S. Cette
			nouvelle
			machine est 40% plus petite que la Xbox One originale et propose un modèle équipé d'un disque dur de 2 To
			de
			stockage. Elle peut également soutenir la vidéo au format Ultra HD, intègre un nouveau lecteur Blu-ray
			Ultra
			HD, et comporte un mode HDR 10. Elle supporte également l'upscaling des jeux spécialement conçus en
			résolution
			plus basse (900p et 1080p). Elle est disponible depuis le 2 août 2016 pour 399 $ pour le modèle 2 To36; le
			22
			septembre 2016, un modèle 500 Go est vendu à 299 dollars, et un modèle 1 To, à 349 dollars.

			Contrairement à la Xbox One originale, la Xbox One S ne comporte pas de bloc d'alimentation externe et peut
			être
			posée à la verticale, tout comme la PlayStation 437.
			Comparaison technique avec la Xbox One classique
			La Xbox One est un peu plus puissante que la Xbox One.

			La fréquence d'horloge du GPU augmente de 853 MHz à 914 MHz sur Xbox One S, par exemple. Ainsi, des
			les performances
			plus les écuries sont notables sur la Xbox One S.38 Aussi, le processeur de la Xbox One classique est gravé
			en
			28
			nanomètres contre 16 nanomètres avec la nouvelle Xbox One, permettant de meilleures performances et
			économies
			d'énergie (permettant par la suite de réduire la puissance de l'alimentation et de l'intégration en interne)
			39.
		</p>
		<h4>Xbox One X</h4>
		<p>During E3 2016, alongside the Xbox One S, Microsoft presents the "Project Scorpio", a console supposed to
			released at the end of 201740. Project Scorpion will be the most powerful console in the world capable
			display
			native Ultra HD and has 6 Teraflops of graphics power. Scorpion Project (Scorpio is the name of the
			processor of this new Xbox) is officially presented at E3 2017. It bears the official name
			of
			Xbox One X. Microsoft announces that it will be available on November 7, 2017 for 499 € 41.42.

			All of the accessories and games that work on Xbox One and Xbox One S work on Xbox One X.
			Microsoft is leveraging multiple games to support the main argument, "Xbox One X is capable of displaying
			Native of Ultra HD ", like Forza Motosport 7 or State of Decay 2. The Xbox One X is also the console of
			the most powerful, but also the smallest, Xbox brand ever created43. However, one of the heaviest
			with
			3.8 kg versus 2.9 kg for the Xbox One S or 3.5 kg for the classic Xbox One.
			Microsoft announces that Xbox One X is "40% more powerful than any existing console at this
			day
			"45. In order to cool the components, Microsoft integrates a room into a console for the first time
			a
			liquid cooled steam. Also for the first time in a console, Dolby technologies
			Atmos, AMD FreeSync and Direct X12 are integrated into the Xbox One X. Dolby Atmos will also be compatible
			with
			the
			Xbox One and Xbox One S thereafter 46,47. FreeSync was previously only available on PC. Implantation
			of
			DirectX 12 directly in the console processor allows in particular to reduce the number of instructions
			a
			send to the processor and increase its efficiency to improve the performance of games using this
			API.



			The Xbox One X is capable of displaying native Ultra HD (3840 x 2160 pixels) on certain games. She is
			however capable of displaying better resolutions, as well as generally higher frame rates
			stable than its rival, due to its more powerful processor and higher computing power48. PS4
			Pro
			rarely displays a real Ultra HD resolution, we often talk about partial rendering (checkerboarding),
			of
			resolution 1080p, or 1440p49 (Note that these techniques also apply to certain games on One X).
			The
			Xbox One X also improves the graphics in Full HD at the system level even in default of the Ultra HD50,
			this
			that PS4 Pro does by choice of developers, via an upgrade from a higher format image to
			a
			smaller format (oversampling). A program started by Microsoft for the console release,
			named "
			Optimized for Xbox One X "serves as an indication to consumers of games that have received attention
			particular from developers to introduce additional features like Ultra resolution
			HD
			and / or better frame rate and / or improved visual effects (including support for HDR) 51.

			Xbox France manager Hugues Ouvrard and Xbox CEO Phil Spencer say "Xbox One X
			East
			without rival ”52.

			A collector's edition is announced at Gamescom 2017. This edition is called Project Scorpio and
			reference to the code name of the console revealed to the general public at E3 2016 alongside the Xbox One
			S. It has
			the
			particularity of having a slightly different design and automatically included a support to put in
			square
			the console in vertical position. This edition was available for pre-order after its announcement, at the
			same
			rate
			than the classic Xbox One X (€ 499). Today it is no longer available for sale.

		</p>
		<h3>Accessoires officiels</h3>
		The Xbox 360 accessories (controller, Kinect, etc.) are incompatible with the Xbox One53. Only the
		different
		headsets are via an adapter54.
		<h4>manettes</h4>
		<p>The controller is quite similar to that of the Xbox 360, although it adopts a more sober and less design
			round,
			with a flatter back. The compartment for the two batteries is integrated into the controller 55, offering
			more
			big
			surface to position his fingers. Both triggers are equipped with vibration, they can vibrate
			independently of the controller and from each other. Microsoft has announced that the two analog sticks and
			the
			directional crosses have gained in sensitivity and precision56. Eight controllers can be connected
			simultanément57.

			The design of the controller has been designed to improve playing comfort during long hours of
			jack-in-hand.

			During his test by Gamekult on the occasion of E3 2013, the journalist William Audureau considers the
			controller
			as the best on the market, advancing the significant progress that has been made to improve the
			comfort of play, and highlighting the new coating of the console and its materials which he describes as
			High
			gamme58.

			During E3 2015, Microsoft announced an improved version of its controller named Elite. This
			controller
			has an even more upscale design than the basic controller, in fact, the triggers and the part
			intended for the charge of the latter are made of metal as well as the analog sticks and the cross
			directional. It has more precise sticks, paddles on the back and accessories
			customization, we can indeed change the basic concave analog sticks by shaped sticks
			of
			dome or concave sticks higher than the basic ones. The user can also change the cross
			basic directional by a sort of circular pad. Thanks to software, all
			sensitivities
			can be adjusted according to the wishes of the user.

			This Elite controller is available for $ 149 or € 149.

			Xbox One controllers (including the Elite) are compatible with Windows 10.

			The Xbox One S controller is improved. The back is micro-perforated to provide comfort in use
			and
			the joysticks have been improved in endurance. We can note a greater Wi-Fi range and
			integration of
			Bluetooth59. </p>
		<h4>Kinect</h4>
		<p>Initially included in each console pack, the Kinect 2 device is sold separately at
			go
			of October 2014 after the announcement of an Xbox One model sold without Kinect60. The device had to
			originally be permanently connected for the Xbox One to function61, but as a result of
			protests from players, Microsoft changes its mind and does not make the device compulsory62. This new
			version with a 1080p camera, can handle 2 GB of data every second. Multitasking, it allows
			the user to voice control several applications running at the same time (television, video,
			Internet, Skype…) 63. You can ask the console to turn on by voice saying "Xbox Start". With
			the
			future operating system of Xbox One based on Windows 10, a few months after its release will arrive
			Cortana
			which will include voice commands.

			The device is able to distinguish the fingers of the player. Microsoft announces that precision is three
			times more faithful than on its first model. Six people can be detected simultaneously. Console
			can
			identify players through facial recognition and determine who is holding which controller,
			she
			also lets you know if the player is looking at the screen or talking.

			In addition, the device can represent the forces exerted by the body, especially when a stroke
			fist
			is given, the camera is capable of faithfully transcribing its power. Heart rate may also
			be detected by Kinect through an analysis of the user's face56. The only price for the camera is
			150
			€.

			Kinect was one of the stages in the development of Microsoft HoloLens holographic headphones, including the
			camera
			at
			been taken over the helmet.


			But Microsoft changed its strategy, which maintained that Kinect was inseparable from the console and sold
			the
			console alone in 2014 to align with the Playstation 4. Many saw the beginnings of an abandonment when
			the
			Xbox One S is presented, without the Kinect port, requiring an adapter, the terms of which
			refund
			are mocked as restrictive64. Device and adapter ceased production in the fall
			201765

		<h3 class="animated bounceInLeft">Notation des jeux</h3>
		<p>PC Gamer's articles are written by magazine editors and by freelance writers. They
			rate the games on a percentage scale. In the American version, no game has yet received a
			score higher than 98% (Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Half-Life 2 and Crysis), while the English version
			has never awarded a score above 96% (Civilization II, Half-Life, Half-Life 2 and Quake II).

			In the English version, the lowest numerical score was 2%, attributed to Big Brother 1. Its sequel, Big
			Brother 2, should have received an even lower rating. In fact, no marks were really given,
			the author of the article explaining that he "made as much effort to test the game as his creators to
			make".

			For the American version, the lowest score currently assigned is 4%, given to Mad Dog
			McCree, subclassing the previously lowest-rated game, Skydive! with 5% (which was technically in
			tied with Extreme Watersports, also rated 5%).

		</p>
		<h3>Éditions</h3><br>
		<h4>Un magazine international</h4>
		<p>There are two main versions of PC Gamer, English and American. Both are published by
			Future Publishing. The original is the English version which has existed since November 1993, its American
			cousin
			was launched in June 1994.

			In July 1997, Edicorp, sister company of Future Publishing, launched PC Games in France, based on the
			version
			British PC Gamer. Future will publish the magazine until October 2007, when it sells its
			French subsidiary. The Yellow Media groups then M.E.R. 7. will continue to publish PC Games until November
			2012. In November 2014, the Nickel Média group, owned by former Edicorp executives, relaunched PC Gamer
			in France, in a variation that borrows little more than its name from its British model.

			There are other local editions which use one of the two editions mentioned above as a basis. The
			English version being for example declined in Malaysian and Russian versions. The Swedish edition, even
			if it is also based on English, tends to be more independent; this is due to the great craze
			proven for PC video games compared to console games in Sweden. An Australian version was
			published monthly by Conspiracy Publishing, since August 1998, but was discontinued mid-year
			2004.

			The two magazines, English and American, are published thirteen times a year (twice in December), at
			some variations. </p>
		<h3>pc gamer UK</h3><br>
		<h4>historique</h4>
		<p>The British edition of PC Gamer has been in constant monthly publication since 1993. Subscribers are entitled
			to a special version of the magazine, without title on the front cover (only the Bear and
			BBFC assessment).

			Almost exclusively devoted to PC games, the magazine has a reputation for giving in-depth reviews.

			The magazine was originally delivered with a 3 "½ floppy disk accompanying it (1" (inch) is 2.54 cm, 3 "
			½ are worth about 9 cm). A demo CD (called CD Gamer) then replaced it from the edition of the number
			11, this first CD containing the content of all the previous floppy disks. Later, the single CD was
			replaced by two CDs.

			An edition with a 9 GB DVD known as the DVD Gamer was published at the same time as the double CD edition
			for two years, until production of CD Gamer ceases at number 162. The British edition is
			now sold only in a version containing a single double layer DVD.

		</p>
		<h4>contenu</h4>
		<p>The magazine has several sections that can be found in each edition. These include the sections of
			"Eyewitness", "Previews", "Cables", where the letters of readers are distributed over two
			pages; at least one special content, which covers topics such as the environmental impact of video games
			; a "review" section containing articles and reviews on the latest games; and an "Extra" section
			Life "which talks about mods, culture around video games and revisits old games.

			There is also a "Systems" section, which reviews and recommends hardware such as video cards
			and monitors. The last page of the magazine is titled "It's All Over" and usually consists of a
			artwork related to video games, for example a diverted version of the table The Persistence of the memory of
			Salvador Dalí staging Portal game objects.

			At one time, one of the section entitled "Gamer Snap", consisted of funny photos sent by
			readers. But it was abandoned and replaced by a "guess the game" where readers
			send a drawing made in Microsoft Paint and representing a memorable scene from a video game.

		<h2 class="animated bounceInRight">Nintendo</h2>
		<h3 class="animated bounceInLeft">Historique</h3>
		<h4>1889–1970 : débuts dans des secteurs variés</h4>
		<p>Founded on September 23, 1889, Nintendo was first named Nintendo Koppaï. This is just a small craft business
			that
			Fusajiro Yamauchi created to sell playing cards, the hanafuda, which he made himself. His cards are becoming
			very popular, so much so that Yamauchi must surround himself with assistants in order to be able to move
			towards
			a more massive production of cards and thus meet demand.

			But it was in 1902 that he began to make the first western-style cards in Japan. In 1907, Fusajirō enlarged
			its
			company by exporting its cards abroad. Fusajiro will retire in 19297 and give way to his son-in-law, Sekiryo
			Yamauchi (originally Sekiryo Kaneda, he adopted the name Yamauchi following Fusajiro's request). The company
			was
			renamed Yamauchi Nintendo & Co. in 1933.

			In 1947, Sekiryo created a new company, Marufuku Co. Ltd (renamed Nintendo Karuta Co. Ltd. in 1951) with the
			aim
			of distributing Hanafudas abroad. It was not until 1949 and the arrival of the young Hiroshi Yamauchi, the
			grandson of Sekiryo Yamauchi (and who was president of Nintendo until 2002), that the activities of the
			company
			would concretely diversify8. For example, we have seen it develop in the market for individual rice
			servings,
			the management of taxi companies and even the owner of a chain of Love Hotels, anecdotal activities.

			In 1951 he changed the name of the company to Nintendo Playing Cards Co. Ltd. In 1953, Nintendo began to
			have
			immense success in manufacturing the first plastic cards in Japan. In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi, great-grandson
			of
			Fusajiro Yamauchi, visited the United States to chat with the United States Playing Card Company, the
			leading
			manufacturer of playing cards. He discovered that the largest playing card company in the world used only a
			small office. Yamauchi's realization that the playing card business had limited potential was a turning
			point.
			He then acquired the license to use Disney characters on playing cards to drive sales. It is thanks to a
			contract signed with Disney in 1959 that the company takes an international scale.
			Nintendo went public in 1962 under the name Nintendo Co. Ltd. In 1965, Nintendo hired Gunpei Yokoi as a
			maintenance engineer for the assembly line. However, Yokoi quickly became famous for much more than his
			ability
			to repair conveyor belts. In 1969, the Games9 department was created, headed by Gunpei Yokoi. The first toy
			of
			the latter is called Ultra Hand and will sell 1.2 million copies. Thereafter, Nintendo will launch other
			toys
			with more or less success like Ultra Machine or Love Tester.

			Today, Nintendo continues to market playing cards10. The firm organizes in parallel its activities its own
			bridge tournament, the Nintendo Cup11.
		</p>
		<h4>1970–1983 : Du Jeu Au Jeu Vidéo</h4>
		<p>It was in the early 1970s that Nintendo turned to the emerging video game market, creating games for arcade
			machines. In 1970 Beam Gun Games were put on sale, using optoelectronics. For the first time in Japan,
			electronic
			technology was entering the toy industry. In 1971, Nintendo launched (only in Japan) a simple photocopier
			called
			"NCM Copillus". It will become a successful product with more than 100,000 units sold. Nintendo collaborates
			with
			Magnavox in the creation of the Odyssey, the first multi-game home console in history (1972).

			In 1973, the Laser Clay Shooting System, which used the same light pistol technology as that used in
			Nintendo's
			Kousenjuu toy series, was installed in abandoned bowling alleys. After some success, Nintendo has developed
			several
			other light pistol machines, such as the Wild Gunman submachine gun shooter which came out in 1974 for the
			emerging
			arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be closed due to excessive costs, Nintendo
			had
			found a new market.

			In 1974 Nintendo obtained the distribution rights for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console in Japan. The
			same
			year, the export to America and Europe began. In 1975, Nintendo developed a video medal games machine called
			"EVR
			race".

			In 1975 Yamauchi began to study some new American trends and devices that could connect to the television to
			play
			simple games, including video games. Some companies, such as Atari, have already had some success in this
			area
			and
			Yamauchi has decided that it will be a good deal for Nintendo. In 1976, it was the start of the
			microprocessor
			in
			video games.
			Dans un contexte d'explosion du marché occidental, Nintendo lance sa première console en 1977, uniquement au
			Japon, la Color TV-Game 612,13. Plusieurs variantes lui succèderont : la Color TV-Game 15 (1977), la Color
			TV
			Game Racing 112 (1978), la Color TV Game Block Kuzushi (1979) et la Computer TV Game (1980). Fonctionnant à
			piles pour la première version, une seconde version avec adaptateur secteur arrivera deux mois plus tard.
			Ces
			consoles n’avaient pas de cartouches de jeu supplémentaires et n’avaient qu’un jeu séparé en plusieurs
			versions
			en fonction de leur difficulté (de 6 à 112 versions selon les consoles). Les microprocesseurs, trop chers à
			fabriquer pour Nintendo, viennent de la société Mitsubishi. Cette console connaîtra un certain succès et
			incitera Nintendo à poursuivre dans ce domaine : avec 350 000 consoles vendues, les Color TV-Game inondent
			le
			marché japonais et représentent 70 % du marché, alors qu'une dizaine d'autres sociétés se partagent les 30 %
			restants14. Durant la même année, en octobre 1977, Nintendo embauche un des plus grands créateur de
			Nintendo,
			Shigeru Miyamoto.

			En 1978, Nintendo ont décidé de commencer à vendre des machines de jeux vidéo professionnelles. Au mois de
			mars
			1978, Nintendo sort un jeu d'arcade simpliste inspiré du jeu de société Othello, intitulé Computer Othello.
			Sur
			fond noir avec le vert comme seule couleur, des pions Othello noirs et blancs sont remplacés respectivement
			par
			des carrés et des signes plus. Pas de joystick pour Computer Othello, seulement dix boutons de couleur par
			joueur. En 1979, Gunpei Yokoi a conçu l'idée d'un jeu vidéo de poche, tout en observant un autre banlieusard
			qui
			a passé le temps en interagissant inutilement avec une calculatrice LCD portable, ce qui a donné naissance à
			Game & Watch.

			Au début des années 1980, la micro-informatique explose et le marché des consoles s’effondre pour la
			première
			fois de sa courte histoire. En effet, à l’époque, les micro-ordinateurs ne coûtent pas plus cher que les
			consoles tout en offrant plus de services. Seule la Famicom, grâce à son prix très compétitif, réussit à
			tirer
			son épingle du jeu. Et alors que Coleco fait faillite, que Mattel et MB s’écartent du marché et qu’Atari et
			Philips se recyclent dans l’informatique, Nintendo se retrouve ainsi sans aucun concurrent. Malgré la
			sortie, en
			1986, de la console Master System de Sega, Nintendo règne en maître incontesté sur le marché des consoles.
			En
			effet, à cette époque, au Japon et aux États-Unis, un foyer sur trois était équipé d’une Famicom. C’est
			grâce à
			la qualité et au nombre important de jeux sortis que la Famicom s’impose, selon la tactique imposée par
			Hiroshi
			Yamauchi.


			In 1980, Nintendo launched the Game and Watch created by Gunpei Yokoi. These electronic games with liquid
			crystal
			display, which take in the pocket, were very successful around the world: in 2008, some very popular
			versions of
			Game and Watch reached prices approaching 500 euros. Gunpei Yokoi, creator of the Metroid game, is also the
			inventor
			of the directional cross which since 1980 benefits from a study patent belonging to the Nintendo company. It
			was
			the
			following year in 1981 that Shigeru Miyamoto's first game, Donkey Kong, was released on arcade machines; In
			this
			game, the two most emblematic characters of Nintendo, Mario and Donkey Kong, appear for the first time.

			Building on these successes, Hiroshi Yamauchi sent his daughter Yoko and son-in-law Minoru Arakawa to the
			United
			States with the aim of establishing a subsidiary there. Nintendo of America, whose head office is located in
			New
			York, was born in 1982. Minoru Arakawa will remain president until 2002. In the same vein, Nintendo of
			America
			opened the same year a subsidiary headquarters in Redmond, near Seattle.

			Return to Japan with the construction of a distribution center in Uji City in 1983 to improve production and
			encourage expansion. Nintendo is also settling in Canada, in Vancouver, and building a family-like video
			game
			center. In the same year, Nintendo of America’s sales hit the $ 10 million mark. In July, Nintendo entered
			the
			first
			stock market in Tokyo15.

			intellectual
			property The Pokémon Company, and although it would receive licenses and other income from the game, he
