                <p>Jaedong is widely revered for his expertise playing Starcraft: Brood War. His creativity on the fly
                    is almost unmatched, and he has the hardware and the prize money to prove it. Between 2007 to 2011,
                    he won three OnGameNet Star leagues and three World Cyber Game titles.

                    His rivalry with Flash is one of the most competitive in all of eSports. They are constantly
                    battling over some of the most sought after titles in all of professional gaming. It's safe to say
                    Jaedong would have easily won more prize money and titles if he didn't have to go head to head with

                    gamers, and easily one of the most celebrated players in United States history. Wendel has been the
                    king of eSports since the late 90s, taking home titles Quake 3 and Counter-strike.

                    Wendel helped usher in a new type of gamer, one who saw it as a vocation and he practiced
                    accordingly. He took his career very seriously, and he became one of the highest paid professionals
                    in the history of eSports.

                    of the professional gaming world.

                    Moon has always displayed the ability to beat anyone put in front of him, no matter the stiffness of
                    the competition, one of the hallmarks of the best gamers in the world. Moon was the highest paid
                    player during his mid to late 00s run, and when all was said and done he left no doubt as to who
                    owns Warcraft.

                    Patrick Lindberg comes from one of the best gaming nations in the world, Sweden. He is best known
                    for his domination of the legendary game Counter-Strike, which helped turn him into one of the best
                    gamers in the world. Counter-Strike was so huge it helped change the face of gaming, and he played
                    on a gaming team in 2009 that had a huge run and won top prize, and it was largely due to his
                    flawless play. With over 50 gold medals sitting on his mantel, Lindberg is one of the best gamers in
                    the world <br>

                <p>Hailing from Japan, Daigo is one of the original eSports icons. He made his name and his prize money
                    playing one of the most important fighting games of all time: Street Fighter. His rivalry with
                    professional gamer Alex Valle helped cement his status as one of the best gamers in the world.

                    His world championship back in 1998 helped open up the gaming world, giving it a more global reach
                    where players would regularly compete with the best of the best. His longevity has been incredible
                    and some of his victories have been viewed over 20 million times on Youtube by gamers.

                    important game in all of eSportsâ€”especially in South Korea.

                    Starcraft has always been a major draw, and often these games are played in front of thousands of
                    rabid fans. South Korea turned many top gamers into celebrities, but perhaps none ever reached the
                    heights of Boxer, as he dominated the Star league (the most important gaming league in Korea) and
                    the World Cyber Games for his entire career.

                    was picked up by Fnatic, the best gaming team in Sweden.

                    From then on, despite being surrounded by elite gamers, it was Alesund who made a real name for
                    himself, and his tag GeT_RiGhT is known for dominance. He invented "lurking" which became an
                    unstoppable technique that'd allow him and his team to become legends.

                    from, and Flash earned a ton of both.

                    From Starcraft alone, Flash racked up over $400,000 in tournament wins, and hundreds of thousands
                    more in contracts and endorsements. He also reigned the longest as the number one ranked player in

                    top, undoubtably becoming one of the best gamers in the world.

                    League of Legends is all about teamwork and strategy, so it's truly remarkable that one player could
                    have such a large impact. He came on the scene at 17, and has already won three World titles, the
                    most famous of which came at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

                            through his dominance in it alone.

                            His dominant run perhaps wasn't as long as many on this list, but at the height of his
