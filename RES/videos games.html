<h2>whats the<span id="mot"> culture game</span>?</h2>
</ul>
<div class="text">What is video game culture, however? What does it mean
 to have a culture defined by the consumption of a particular medium? 
Moreover, what are the implications of defining this culture in a 
particular way? While there has been a great deal of ink split on video 
game culture, the actual definition of the term is often treated as 
common sense. Unpacking the discourses surrounding video game culture 
allows us to see the power dynamics involved in attributing certain 
characteristics to it, as well as naming it video game culture as such. 
This has implications for how video games are studied and is connected 
with how culture is studied more broadly. By critically examining how 
video game culture has been defined in both press and academic articles,
 this paper illuminates how this definition has limited the study of 
video games and where it can move.

<h4>this is<span id="duty"> tournament of call of duty</span> </h4>

The Call of Duty World League and Call of Duty Pro League both bring 
together professional players to compete and climb the international 
ladder. Only the most elite players reach the Call of Duty Championship,
 which has been the game's highest level since 2013.
Each competition is held on the most recent version of the game. The 
2018 Championship, won by the Evil Geniuses, was played on Call of Duty:
 WWII, while the 2019 competition will be played on Call of Duty: Black 
Ops 4.
This year's competition will also concentrate on amateur play, allowing 
fans to compete in order to qualify for prize pools at the CWL Open 
Bracket and CWL Finals. This will also give players a chance to to 
compete in the Call of Duty Championship.<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/call%2520of%2520duty%2520tournament.jpg" width="1000px/"> <hr>

<h3>10. Peter “ppd” Dager</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/ppd.jpg">
Landing on the tenth spot is American player Peter “ppd” Dager, who 
first began his esports career at Heroes of Newerth.
In his transition to Dota 2, Dager initially played with a few unpopular
 teams alongside Swedish player Ludwig “zai” Wahlberg.
Despite his infamy for being “salty” in the industry, Dager has proven 
his worth multiple times as a master tactician and innovative drafter, 
paving way for the success of latter prominent teams he would be part 
of, such as Evil Geniuses.
Dager’s earnings are currently sitting at<span id="prix"> $2,880,266.36 </span>,
 with its largest chunk coming from EG’s five-streak championships at 
World E-sport Championships 2014, StarLadder Series Season 10, Dota 2 
Asia Championships 2015, Dota Pit League Season 3, and The International
 2015.
He is currently playing for Ninjas in Pyjamas.<br>
<h3>9. Saahil “UNiVeRsE” Arora<br></h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/universe.jpg">
Occupying the ninth spot is American player Saahil “UNiVeRsE” Arora, who
 is dubbed as a seasoned veteran in the Dota 2 community.
Playing since 2011, Arora has already been with different teams such as 
Online Kingdom, It’s Gosu, Quantic, and Dignitas. He is widely acclaimed
 for his stint at Evil Geniuses and Team Secret.
Arora is famous for playing offlane with his signature Heroes Faceless 
Void and Dark Seer. His so-called “six million dollar Echo Slam” with 
Earthshaker during The International 2015 is considered one of the 
greatest plays in Dota 2 history.
Arora’s earnings are currently sitting at<span id="saahil"> $3,027,735.67</span>,
 primarily due to EG’s championship streak at StarLadder Series Season 
10, Dota 2 Asia Championships 2015, Dota Pit League Season 3, and The 
International 2015.
He currently plays for Fnatic after relocating in Malaysia.<br>
<h3>8. Maroun “GH” Merhej</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/gh.jpg">
Settling on the eighth spot is Lebanese player Maroun “GH” Merhej, who 
was once considered to only be a pubstar before he reached success.
After reaching above 9k MMR in the Dota 2 leaderboards in Europe, Merhej
 was able to enter the professional scene when he served as a stand-in 
support player for Team Liquid at DreamLeague Season 6—where they also 
became champions.
Since then, Merhej has been part of Team Liquid which will bag different
 major championships such as StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3, 
EPICENTER 2017, The International 2017, StarLadder i-League Invitational
 Season 3, AMD Sapphire Dota PIT League, StarLadder i-League 
Invitational Season 3, and the China Dota 2 Supermajor.
Merhej is famous for playmaker support Heroes such as Earthshaker and 
Earth Spirit.
His earnings are currently sitting at<span id="maroun"> $3,056,909.18</span>.
<h3>7. Sumail “SumaiL” Hassan</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/sumail.jpg">
On the seventh spot is Pakistani player Sumail “SumaiL” Hassan.
Ever since his membership at Evil Geniuses since 2015, Hassan has carved
 a niche in the professional scene already despite being the team’s 
youngest player.
Hassan’s fame in Dota 2 began with his Eul’s Scepter of Divinity build 
on Shadow Fiend mid during the Dota 2 Asia Championships 2015, 
influencing the metagame with his build at the time. His breakout in the
 tournament is through his Storm Spirit, which carried EG to victory 
despite having a bad 0-3 start.
Since then, Hassan is considered one of the most prominent mid players 
in Dota 2, despite being outspoken on social media regarding issues in 
the esports world.
His earnings are currently sitting at<span id="sumail"> $3,265,914.94</span>.
<h3>6. Jesse “JerAx” Vainikka</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/jerax.jpg">
Lodging on the sixth spot is Finnish player Jesse “JerAx” Vainikka.
Vainikka’s humble beginnings as a support player can be traced from his 
inclusion at different teams such as Rat in the Dark, QPAD Red Pandas, 4
 Anchors + Sea Captain, Team Tinker, MVP HOT6ix, and 5Jungz.
Vainikka’s greatest performances are with his membership at Team Liquid 
in 2016, which carried on even in his transfer at OG after that year’s 
The International. Some of his best Heroes are Earth Spirit, Rubick, and
 Io.
With championships such as the EPICENTER 2016, The Boston Major 2016, 
The Kiev Major 2017, MDL Macau Major, and The International 2018 under 
his belt, Vainikka’s earnings are currently sitting at<span id="jesse"> $3,306,463.82</span>.
<h3>5. Lasse “MATUMBAMAN” Urpalainen</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/matumbaman.jpg">
On the fifth spot is Finnish player Lasse “MATUMBAMAN” Urpalainen.
Urpalainen rose to fame when he won the Assembly Summer 2014 with his 
team Veni, Vidi, Vici. As a “new” player during the time, his 
surprisingly high mechanical skills caught the attention of Dota 2 
enthusiasts.
Urpalainen’s invitation at 5Jungz, which soon became Team Liquid, paved 
way for his outstanding career in esports, where he holds championships 
at EPICENTER 2016, StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3, EPICENTER 
2017, The International 2017, and the China Dota 2 Supermajor.
Known for his Broodmother, Visage, Lone Druid, and Lycan, Urpalainen’s 
earnings are currently sitting at<span id="lasse"> $3,438,116.04</span>.

<h3>4. Ivan “MinD_ContRoL” Ivanov</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/feres.jpg">
Settling on the fourth spot is Bulgarian player Ivan “MinD_ContRoL” 
Ivanov.
For the longest time, Ivanov has been a free agent because of his 
tendencies to have a new roster with his team, Basically Unknown, every 
once in a while. He also tried his luck out with teams like Oslik Gaming
 and Burden United.
Upon his invitation at Team Liquid, Ivanov has finally settled and found
 his place in the world of Dota 2, bagging the championships at 
EPICENTER 2016, StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3, EPICENTER 2017,
 The International 2017, and the China Dota 2 Supermajor.
One of Ivanov’s notable performances in his esports career is his 
playmaker Nature’s Prophet during The International 2017. His earnings 
are currently sitting at<span id="ivan"> $3,438,411.76</span>.
<h3>3. Amer “Miracle-“ Al-Barqawi</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/miracle.jpg">
Occupying the third spot is Polish-Jordanian player Amer “Miracle-“ 
Al-Barqawi, who gained critical attention after toppling Romanian player
 Aliwi “w33” Omar from the Dota 2 European leaderboards.
After reaching the top, Al-Barqawi was recruited at (monkey) Business, 
now OG, which served as a springboard for his rise to fame.
A prodigy of sorts, Al-Barqawi garnered a massive following for his 
high-level performances as a mid and safelane player for OG. This 
boosted even more when he became the first player in the world to reach 
9k MMR.
Despite transferring to Team Liquid after The International 2016, 
Al-Barqawi maintained winning tournaments. He currently has seven 
championships under his belt: The Frankfurt Major 2015, The Manila Major
 2016, ESL One Frankfurt 2016 (OG); StarLadder i-League StarSeries 
Season 3, EPICENTER 2017, The International 2017, and China Dota 2 
Supermajor (Team Liquid).
His earnings are currently sitting at<span id="amer"> $3,671,337.28</span>.
<h3>2. Johan “n0tail” Sundstein</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/notail.jpg">
Landing on the second spot is Danish player Johan “n0tail” Sundstein, 
who has long been in the esports scene since his Heroes of Newerth days.
He made a name for himself in several HoN online tournaments, under team
 Fnatic. He also won consecutive LAN tournaments such as the DreamHack.
In his transition to Dota 2, along with Fnatic teammates such as Tal 
“Fly” Aizik and Adrian “Era” Kryeziu, Sundstein was able to be part of 
upper seed teams in tournaments, albeit not winning championships.
Sundstein joined Team Secret in 2014, which won the XMG Captains Draft 
2.0.
He then soon founded OG, formerly (monkey) Business, in 2015, the first 
Dota 2 team to ever hold four Major titles: Frankfurt, Manila, Boston, 
and Kiev.
OG was incapable to participate in the China Dota 2 Supermajor due to 
Aizik’s and Gustav “s4” Magnusson’s sudden departure, leaving the team 
only a few weeks’ time to prepare for The International 2018 Open 
Qualifiers (the “most bottom” of the tournament).
However, they still managed to emerge as champions after a rough 3-2 
finish vs. PSD-LGD mainly through “comeback” games. As a result, 
Sundstein’s earnings are currently sitting at<span id="johan"> $3,733,970.56</span>.
<h3>1. Kuro “KuroKy” Takhasomi</h3>
<img src="videos%20games_fichiers/bouderhem.jpg">
German player Kuro “KuroKy” Takhasomi still wears the crown for being 
the highest earning gamer in the world, as of 2018, with a whopping 
total winnings of <span id="kuro">$4,097,926.95</span>.
Since Defense of the Ancients, or the so-called Dota 1, Takhasomi was 
already playing competitively under mousesports in 2008. At one event, 
he met Estonian player Clement “Puppey” Ivanov, who will be greatly 
influential in his esports career.
During the Dota 2 adaptation, Takhasomi’s early days were not much 
successful with teams such as GosuGamers.net, PANZER, and 10,000th.
He soon settled with Natus Vincere in 2013, alongside legendary players 
such as Oleksandr “XBOCT” Dashkevych, Gleb “Funn1k” Lipatnikov, Danil 
“Dendi” Ishutin, and Ivanov, landing second place at The International 
that year in a tooth and nail five-game series against Alliance.
He continued seeking greener pastures at Team Secret in 2014 as the 
carry, but was only partly successful by winning second at the Star 
Ladder despite his stellar performances. After some roster changes, he 
went back to playing support and paved way for the team to win some LAN 
tournaments, but was still unsuccessful after a terrible performance at 
The International 2015.
Takhasomi then founded 5Jungz, now Team Liquid, which bagged multiple 
championships such as the EPICENTER 2016, StarLadder i-League SarSeries 
Season 3, EPICENTER 2017, The International 2017, and the China Dota 2 
Supermajor.
He is the first professional Dota 2 player to win 1000 games and play 
107 different Heroes in his esports career.
With this list, Dota 2 has taken the charts by storm.
On the Top 100 highest overall earnings list provided by e-Sports 
Earnings, 77 are Dota 2 players. The Top 50 are also dominated by them.
Counter Strike: Global Offensive managed to register only 16 players.
The number of representatives from other games are measly: League of 
Legends (four), Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare (two), and StarCraft II 
(one).
